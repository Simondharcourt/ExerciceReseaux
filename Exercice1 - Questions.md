Question1: Done in histogram.py

Question2: Done in question2.py

Question3: A simulation with 100 000 peers and a maximum peer pool size of 100 run in 97 seconds.
Which means that with 1 000 000 peers, the simulation would run in 970 seconds whis is 16 minutes.
With 10 000 000 peers or a maximum peer pool size of 1 000, the simulation would run in 9 700 seconds which is almost 3 hours.
If we have to do this calcul regularly, it takes too much time.


Question4: A first idea which could solve the problem is to compute the bins before retrieving the information.
(This would be done almost instantly on the user's laptop).
Then the backend just has to sum all the arrays he received from the users.

A simulation with 100 000 peers and a maximum peer pool size of 100 run in 11 seconds which means that with 1 000 000 peers, 
the simulation would run in 110 seconds. 
This is more achievable.
